# landing-page
here's an example of a complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a landing page

This code defines a basic HTML structure with a header, navigation bar, three sections (Features, Pricing, and About), and a footer. The CSS for styling the page is defined in a separate file ('style.css'), and the JavaScript code is defined in another separate file ('script.js').

The header contains a large heading, a brief description of the product, and a call-to-action (CTA) button that takes the user to the Features section. The navigation bar contains links to the Features, Pricing, and About sections. Each section contains a heading and some content specific to that section. The Pricing section also includes a list of pricing plans. The About section includes a brief description of the company and another CTA button that can be used to contact the company.

Note that this is just a basic example and the actual content and styling of a landing page will depend on the specific needs of the project. However, this example provides a good starting point for building a simple landing page.
